## Importance of *Project Based Learning:*
Projects can help you:

* **Build confidence**: You will believe more in your ability to create software regardless the level of complexity.

* **Explore other technologies**: You will learn about other technologies needed in building a complete product such as databases, servers, and other languages.

* **Understand programming concepts better**: You will learn to write code better and understand concepts such as design patterns and object-oriented programming (which will be done in [Week 2](https://github.com/ProjectBasedLearning/resources/blob/master/Python_basics2.md)). 

* **Experience a complete software development life cycle**: You will learn how to plan before writing code, manage the coding process and update software.


### Working on projects can be difficult. That’s one reason why motivation and interest in a project will make it a less daunting task.
If you’re interested in a project, you’ll be able to put in the time to research as well as find libraries and tools that will help you with the project.
### While working on a project, follow a simple procedure:
* Find a source of motivation
* Break the project into subtasks
* Do research on the subtasks
* Build each subtasks, one step at a time
* **Reach out for help if you’re stuck**
* Put the subtasks together

## Happy Coding!
