# linear-regression

Welcome to week 6 of PBL!
This week we will be focusing on the most basic algorithm in machine learning, which is Linear Regression

### one can find n number of datasets on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) and [UCI.](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.php)

### Note: One can use processed datasets from week 3/5 or use any other dataset and apply linear regression on it.
